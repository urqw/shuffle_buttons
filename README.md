# Shuffle Buttons

*Version from 2025-04-05 for UrqW 1.0.*

A plugin for [UrqW](https://github.com/urqw/UrqW) that shuffles choice buttons.

Each time before rendering a list of choice buttons (`btn`), the plugin shuffles the list and displays the buttons in a random order.

The plugin and an example of its use can be found in the urqw directory. A demo of the plugin can be viewed at <https://urqw.github.io/UrqW#shuffle_buttons>

For other UrqW plugins, see the [common repository](https://github.com/urqw/plugins).

Be careful, though: not all UrqW plugins can be easily combined.
